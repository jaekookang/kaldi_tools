The optional-silence phone sil occupies 31.5% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 93.7% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 26.9% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 4.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (40,67.8,177)
