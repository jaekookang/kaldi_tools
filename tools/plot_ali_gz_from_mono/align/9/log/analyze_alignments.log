The optional-silence phone sil occupies 30.9% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 93.9% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 26.4% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 3.8% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (38,70.5,177)
