CHAPTER ELEVEN THE MORROW BROUGHT A VERY SOBER LOOKING MORNING THE SUN MAKING ONLY A FEW EFFORTS TO APPEAR AND CATHERINE AUGURED FROM IT EVERYTHING MOST FAVOURABLE TO HER WISHES
DECLINED GIVING ANY ABSOLUTE PROMISE OF SUNSHINE SHE APPLIED TO MISSUS ALLEN AND MISSUS ALLEN'S OPINION WAS MORE POSITIVE SHE HAD NO DOUBT IN THE WORLD OF ITS BEING A VERY FINE DAY IF THE CLOUDS WOULD ONLY GO OFF AND THE SUN KEEP OUT
AT ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK HOWEVER A FEW SPECKS OF SMALL RAIN UPON THE WINDOWS CAUGHT CATHERINE'S WATCHFUL EYE AND OH DEAR I DO BELIEVE IT WILL BE WET BROKE FROM HER IN A MOST DESPONDING TONE
I THOUGHT HOW IT WOULD BE SAID MISSUS ALLEN NO WALK FOR ME TODAY SIGHED CATHERINE BUT PERHAPS IT MAY COME TO NOTHING OR IT MAY HOLD UP BEFORE TWELVE PERHAPS IT MAY BUT THEN MY DEAR
IT WILL BE SO DIRTY OH THAT WILL NOT SIGNIFY I NEVER MIND DIRT NO REPLIED HER FRIEND VERY PLACIDLY I KNOW YOU NEVER MIND DIRT AFTER A SHORT PAUSE
IT COMES ON FASTER AND FASTER SAID CATHERINE AS SHE STOOD WATCHING AT A WINDOW SO IT DOES INDEED IF IT KEEPS RAINING THE STREETS WILL BE VERY WET THERE ARE FOUR UMBRELLAS UP ALREADY HOW I HATE THE SIGHT OF AN UMBRELLA
THERE WILL BE VERY FEW PEOPLE IN THE PUMP ROOM IF IT RAINS ALL THE MORNING I HOPE MISTER ALLEN WILL PUT ON HIS GREATCOAT WHEN HE GOES BUT I DARE SAY HE WILL NOT FOR HE HAD RATHER DO ANYTHING IN THE WORLD THAN WALK OUT IN A GREATCOAT I WONDER HE SHOULD DISLIKE IT IT MUST BE SO COMFORTABLE
THE RAIN CONTINUED FAST THOUGH NOT HEAVY
THE RAIN CONTINUED FAST THOUGH NOT HEAVY CATHERINE WENT EVERY FIVE MINUTES TO THE CLOCK THREATENING ON EACH RETURN THAT IF IT STILL KEPT ON RAINING ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES SHE WOULD GIVE UP THE MATTER AS HOPELESS
THE CLOCK STRUCK TWELVE AND IT STILL RAINED YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GO MY DEAR I DO NOT QUITE DESPAIR YET I SHALL NOT GIVE IT UP TILL A QUARTER AFTER TWELVE
THIS IS JUST THE TIME OF DAY FOR IT TO CLEAR UP AND I DO THINK IT LOOKS A LITTLE LIGHTER THERE IT IS TWENTY MINUTES AFTER TWELVE AND NOW I SHALL GIVE IT UP ENTIRELY OH THAT WE HAD SUCH WEATHER HERE AS THEY HAD AT UDOLPHO
